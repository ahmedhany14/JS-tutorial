// what is a strict mode?
/*
 Strict mode is a way to write secure JavaScript code.
 It is a special mode that you can enable in JavaScript to catch common coding mistakes and "unsafe" actions. It is a literal expression, omitted in the past, which indicates that the code should be executed in "strict mode". With strict mode, you can not, for example, use undeclared variables.

// functions

// There are three typs of functions in JavaScript
// 1. Function Declaration
// 2. Function Expression
// 3. Arrow Function

// Function Declaration
/*
 1. like any programming language, a function is a block of code that can be called by name.
 2. A function can have parameters, which are values that are passed to the function.
 3. A function can return a value.
 4. A fucntion can be called at any line in the code.
*/
/*
function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5, called after the function declaration
console.log(sub(5, 2)); // 10, called before the function declaration

function sub(a, b) {
  return a - b;
}
*/


// Function Expression
/*
 1. A function expression is similar to and has the same syntax as a function declaration
 2. The main difference between a function expression and a function declaration is the function name,
which can be omitted in function expressions to create anonymous functions.
 3. Function expressions can be used as IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) which runs as soon as it is defined.
 4. Function expressions can't be called before creating the fucntion.
*/
/*

let add = function (a, b) {
    return a + b;
}
const sub = function (a, b) {
    return a - b;
}
let tow = add(10, 20)
let s = sub(10, 20)
console.log(tow)
console.log(s)
*/


// Arrow Function
/*
 1. Arrow functions are a more concise way of writing function expressions.
 2. Arrow functions do not have their own this. They are not well suited for defining object methods.
 3. Arrow functions are not hoisted, they must be defined before they are used.
 4. Arrow functions are always anonymous.
 5. Arrow functions are best suited for non-method functions.
 6. Arrow functions are not suited as methods, and they cannot be used as constructors.

const add = (a, b) => a + b;
const sub = (a, b) => a - b;

Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new gymnastics discipline, which works differently.
Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so one average score per team).
A team ONLY wins if it has at least DOUBLE the average score of the other team. Otherwise, no team wins!

1. Create an arrow function 'calcAverage' to calculate the average of 3 scores
2. Use the function to calculate the average for both teams
3. Create a function 'checkWinner' that takes the average score of each team as parameters ('avgDolhins' and 'avgKoalas'), and then logs the winner to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above. Example: "Koalas win (30 vs. 13)".
4. Use the 'checkWinner' function to determine the winner for both DATA 1 and DATA 2.
5. Ignore draws this time.

TEST DATA 1: Dolphins score 44, 23 and 71. Koalas score 65, 54 and 49
TEST DATA 2: Dolphins score 85, 54 and 41. Koalas score 23, 34 and 27

HINT: To calculate average of 3 values, add them all together and divide by 3
HINT: To check if number A is at least double number B, check for A >= 2 * B. Apply this to the team's average scores ðŸ˜‰

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

/*
Steven is still building his tip calculator, using the same rules as before:
 Tip 15% of the bill if the bill value is between 50 and 300, and if the value is different, the tip is 20%.

1. Write a function 'calcTip' that takes any bill value as an input and returns the corresponding tip, 
   calculated based on the rules above (you can check out the code from first tip calculator challenge if you need to). Use the function type you like the most. Test the function using a bill value of 100.
2. And now let's use arrays! So create an array 'bills' containing the test data below.
3. Create an array 'tips' containing the tip value for each bill, calculated from the function you created before.
4. BONUS: Create an array 'total' containing the total values, so the bill + tip.

TEST DATA: 125, 555 and 44

HINT: Remember that an array needs a value in each position, and that value can actually be the returned value of a function! So you can just call a function as array values (so don't store the tip values in separate variables first, but right in the new array) ðŸ˜‰

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
*/

const calcTip = (bill) => {
    return bill >= 50 && bill <= 300 ? bill * 0.15 : bill * 0.2;
}


let bills = [125, 555, 44];

let tips = bills.map(bill => calcTip(bill));
console.log("tips : ",tips.join(", "));
let total = bills.map((bill, index) => bill + tips[index]);
console.log("total : ",total.join(", "));
